## 4. Voice & Tone

### 4.1 Overall Character
The Mangaroa voice is **warm, grounded, purposeful, and editorial**. It speaks from the land, not about it. It invites rather than sells. It uses the language of stewardship, not ownership.

### 4.2 Key Attributes
- **Grounded**: Rooted in place, season, and soil. Avoids abstraction.
- **Invitational**: "We welcome those ready to remember." Not pushy, not transactional.
- **Reverent**: Deep respect for whenua, te ao Maori, and ecological systems. Uses te reo Maori naturally and purposefully (not tokenistically).
- **Editorial**: Long-form, considered, narrative-driven. Favours storytelling over bullet points in main content.
- **Honest**: Does not overclaim. Acknowledges the journey ("from a place of depletion toward a living, resilient valley").
- **Community-oriented**: Always "we" and "our", rarely "I". Frames the farm as a collective endeavour.

### 4.3 Te Reo Maori Usage
Te reo is woven naturally into copy, not italicised or footnoted. Key terms used on site:
- **whenua** - land
- **kai** - food
- **maara** - garden
- **kete** - basket
- **whanau** - family/extended family
- **korero** - conversation/talk
- **ngahere** - forest
- **kaitiaki** - guardian/steward
- **rongoā Maori** - traditional Maori medicine/healing
- **whakapapa** - genealogy/lineage
- **kaupapa Maori** - Maori principles/philosophy
- **mauri** - life force/essence
- **taonga** - treasure/precious
- **mahi** - work
- **Hua Parakore** - Maori organics verification
- **Te Awa Kairangi** - the Hutt River system

### 4.4 Phrases & Patterns (direct from site)
- "A living laboratory"
- "A living classroom"
- "Nestled alongside the Mangaroa River"
- "Transitioning dairy & pine into regenerative agriculture & native forests"
- "Come home to the land. Come home to yourself."
- "A reciprocal exchange of energy"
- "Cultivating an eco-cultural landscape"
- "In service to the soil, the seasons, and the future"
- "Restoring the mauri of the whenua"
- "Every trap, every decision is part of a bigger picture"
- "Our largest underground livestock - the soil mycelium network"
- "For future generations"
- "Slow down, breathe deep"
- "Find stillness & regeneration in nature's sanctuary"
- "The answer is community. When we weave each other together we are strong and resilient."

### 4.5 What NOT to do
- Do not use corporate jargon or startup language
- Do not use "sustainable" as a buzzword without substance
- Do not separate people from land in framing ("connecting people with nature" not "teaching people about nature")
- Do not reduce te reo Maori to decoration
- Do not overclaim impact - always frame as a journey
- Do not use urgency/scarcity marketing tactics
- Avoid emojis in editorial/narrative content (acceptable in casual social/event promotion)

## 10. Writing Guidelines for This Project

When writing copy for the impact reporting site:

1. **Lead with story, not stats.** Frame data within narrative context ("As our bush recovers..." not "We removed 1,112 pests").
2. **Use the journey frame.** Where we are now, where we're heading, and what the evidence shows.
3. **Honour the land as a living system.** The river, soil, forest, and wildlife are characters, not resources.
4. **Use te reo naturally.** Whenua, kai, mauri, korero - woven in, not translated in brackets.
5. **Keep the editorial serif tone.** Unhurried, considered, generous with whitespace.
6. **Avoid overclaiming.** "Signs of recovery" not "fully restored". "Progress toward" not "achieved".
7. **Centre community.** The work is collective. Name the people where appropriate. Use "we" and "our".
8. **Connect to the bigger picture.** Predator control serves birdlife serves forest serves water serves people. Always show the web.
9. **Match the emotional register of the main site.** Warm, invitational, slightly poetic without being precious.
10. **Respect the sensitivity of People data.** First names only, aggregated stats for public display, frame as community contribution.
